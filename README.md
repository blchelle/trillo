## Note 📝
I created Trillo to practice using CSS Flexbox to build practical layouts. This project was also an excellent way to practice using SASS so that I could better undertand the tradeoffs that are made when choosing SASS vs. CSS. The project is mainly "view only" since improving my CSS skills was the primary goal of this project.

## Technology Stack 💻
